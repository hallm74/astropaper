description: The FBI's recent warning about messaging app security highlights the importance of using end-to-end encryption to protect communications. However, it overlooks critical points about the potential vulnerabilities and lawful access capabilities of these platforms, underscoring the need for users to remain cautious even when using encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Signal.

The FBI's recommendation to use encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal underscores the importance of securing our communications. However, this advice overlooks the government's investigation into messaging platforms, which could hinder Apple's ability to maintain its end-to-end secure system. For instance, the push for greater interoperability—highlighted in debates over Apple's "green bubble"—might compel Apple to open its tightly controlled ecosystem, potentially compromising security.

This concern is amplified by incidents like the [Salt Typhoon](https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/u-s-wiretap-systems-targeted-in-china-linked-hack-327fc63b?utm_source=chatgpt.com) attack, where Chinese hackers infiltrated U.S. telecom networks, including systems used for lawful wiretaps. Such breaches demonstrate that efforts to promote openness and competition could inadvertently weaken data protection. 

Personally, I prefer a secure, closed proprietary ecosystem over an open, less secure one.

>Our suggestion, what we have told folks internally, is not new here: Encryption is your friend, whether it’s on text messaging or if you have the capacity to use encrypted voice communication,” said Jeff Greene, executive assistant director for cybersecurity at CISA, during a call with reporters. “Even if the adversary is able to intercept the data, if it is encrypted, it will make it impossible.
