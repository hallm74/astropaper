`I’m working on a project to convert a historical site currently hosted on WordPress into a static site. I’ll share more details in a future post, but my first step was to train ChatGPT to understand my frontmatter. This will allow me to process batches of files through ChatGPT and convert the frontmatter as needed.`

Managing blog content can be tedious, especially when consistency in frontmatter is crucial. This guide will walk you through the process of training ChatGPT to generate frontmatter perfectly tailored to your Astro blog. By the end, you’ll have an AI assistant capable of streamlining your blogging workflow.

## Table of Contents

## Step 1: Define Your Frontmatter Structure

The first step is to identify the fields required in your frontmatter. For example, the frontmatter structure for an Astro blog might look like this:

```yaml
author: hallm
pubDatetime: 2024-12-03T20:00:14
title: Sabine Parish Test Title
ogImage: 
featured: true
draft: false
tags:
    - test
    - sabine
    - parish
    - lorem
description: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
```

### Key Points

- **Mandatory Fields**: Ensure fields like `author`, `pubDatetime`, `title`, and `description` are required.
- **Default Values**: Specify default values, such as `author: hallm`, `featured: true`, and `draft: false`.
- **Formatting Rules**: Use consistent formatting for fields like `tags` (formatted as a JSON array with four spaces before the dashes).

## Step 2: Teach ChatGPT Your Preferences

Once you’ve defined your structure, share it with ChatGPT and explain the rules. Here’s how:

1. **Provide the Structure**: Share your frontmatter template with ChatGPT and outline each field’s purpose.
2. **Specify Defaults and Rules**:
   - `draft` defaults to `false`.
   - `featured` defaults to `true`.
   - No colons allowed in `title` or `description`.
3. **Adjust as Needed**: Train ChatGPT iteratively. If you notice a mistake, correct it and clarify the rule.

## Step 3: Generate a Test Post

To ensure ChatGPT understands your requirements, request a test blog post. For example:

**Prompt:**

Create a blog post titled “Sabine Parish Test Title” with a 10-word Lorem Ipsum description. Include the necessary frontmatter and content in Markdown.

**Output Example:**

```markdown

## Introduction to Sabine Parish

Sabine Parish is a charming location with rich cultural history...
```

## Step 4: Add Rules for Content

If your content has specific rules (e.g., Markdown format only), ensure ChatGPT follows them. For example:

- Use Markdown headings and subheadings.
- Avoid colons in the title and description.

## Step 5: Iterate and Refine

The key to training ChatGPT is iteration. As you generate posts, refine ChatGPT’s understanding by:

1. Highlighting errors.
2. Reconfirming rules or preferences.
3. Adding new rules as needed.

## Conclusion

Training ChatGPT to write frontmatter for your Astro blog is a straightforward process that saves time and ensures consistency. With a little effort upfront, you can transform ChatGPT into an invaluable tool for managing your blog.
