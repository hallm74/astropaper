description: Walmart acquires Vizio to enhance its advertising business with Platform Plus, Vizio’s advertising and data division.
---

Walmart has completed its acquisition of Vizio for $2.3 billion, a move aimed at enhancing its advertising capabilities through Vizio’s Platform Plus, the TV maker’s advertising and data division. This acquisition allows Walmart to leverage Vizio’s data to target ads on platforms like Disney Plus and Hulu, as well as potentially on Vizio TVs both in stores and in customers’ homes. Privacy advocates have expressed concerns due to Vizio’s past issues with data tracking, which led to a $2.2 million fine in 2017. Despite the acquisition, Walmart and Vizio will continue to operate independently for the foreseeable future, with Vizio’s CEO, William Wang, remaining in his position. 

> "VIZIO has also expertly changed their business over time, like building and quickly scaling a profitable advertising business. Pairing it with Walmart Connect will be impactful and allow us to invest in our business even further on behalf of our customers." – Seth Dallaire, Walmart’s Executive Vice President and Chief Growth Officer

Last week, I found myself in need of a replacement TV for my patio. After scouring deals, I stumbled upon Walmart's Black Friday special on a Roku TV—just the right size and at a price too good to pass up. While the installation was a breeze, the most time-consuming part of the experience wasn’t setting it up—it was navigating the endless stream of ads and promotional content that popped up before I could even start streaming my favorite shows.

It’s experiences like these that make Walmart’s latest acquisition of Vizio all the more concerning. I'd rather not have adware or malware built into my TV.
