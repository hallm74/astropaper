    According to Mark Gurman’s latest Power On newsletter, Apple has no ‘meaningful’ plans to refresh AirPods Max after the introduction of the USB-C model earlier this year.

It’s disappointing that Apple hasn’t invested more in enhancing the AirPods Max. I’ve used the same pair daily since their release, and prior to that, my over-ear headphones typically lasted only a couple of years. I agree with Mark Gurman’s observation that there’s a market for them. However, the recent USB-C update wasn’t substantial enough to motivate existing users to upgrade. It would be great to see the AirPods Max receive the same level of attention and innovation as the AirPods and AirPods Pro. Additionally, considering that they still feature the same electronics as the 2020 model, a price reduction would be beneficial, as they continue to be priced at a premium.

>The headphones aren’t a hot enough seller to justify pouring money into development, but they’re also not a big enough flop to kill them outright. If you’ve ever been to an upscale gym in Los Angeles or New York, you can see these $550 headphones have a market — even with the high price and outdated technology.
