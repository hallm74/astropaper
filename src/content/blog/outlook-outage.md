description: Thousands of Microsoft 365 customers worldwide reported having issues with services like Outlook and Teams on Monday.

On November 25, 2024, Microsoft 365 experienced a significant outage, disrupting services like Outlook and Teams for users worldwide. As an IT professional, I felt the impact firsthand, with my daily workflow coming to a standstill. In all the years we’ve used and managed Office 365, we’ve never encountered an issue of this scale.

The problems began early in the day, with users reporting difficulties accessing emails, loading calendars, and opening applications like PowerPoint. Microsoft acknowledged the issue, attributing it to a recent change affecting Exchange Online and Teams calendar functionalities. By noon Eastern Time, the company reported that approximately 98% of affected environments had been restored. However, recovery efforts faced delays, and many users continued to experience disruptions throughout the day. ￼

This incident highlights our heavy reliance on cloud-based services. When such platforms go down, it disrupts not only our tasks but also our communication channels. It’s a stark reminder of the importance of having backup plans and alternative communication methods in place.

While Microsoft is working to resolve the issues, ￼ this event serves as a wake-up call for all of us to reassess our preparedness for such disruptions. Ensuring we have contingency plans can help us navigate these challenges more smoothly in the future.
