Earlier this month, I read a [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/11/01/ai-code-and-the-future-of-software-engineers/) discussing AI's impact on software engineering. This became particularly relevant when I used ChatGPT to generate most of the code for a recent blog post on scripting in [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/), significantly reducing my coding and troubleshooting time.

>The majority of developers (70%) believe that AI-assisted coding will provide them with a competitive edge in their work. They anticipate several key advantages, including improved code quality, faster completion times and more efficient incident resolution.

AI tools are becoming essential for software engineers, much like how modern code editors have become standard. They enhance efficiency by automating routine tasks, allowing developers to focus on more complex aspects of their projects. As AI technology continues to advance, integrating these tools into daily workflows is becoming increasingly important for staying competitive in the field.
