For the past two years, this has been my go-to cranberry sauce recipe because it’s easy to make in a slow cooker with minimal effort. I’ve linked the original source below and doubled the recipe since that’s the amount I usually prepare.

# Cranberry Sauce with Grand Marnier (Doubled Recipe)

This recipe adds a sophisticated twist to traditional cranberry sauce, perfect for your holiday table.

## Ingredients

- 6 cups fresh cranberries (approximately two 12 oz. packages)
- 1 ½ cups sugar
- ½ cup water
- 2 medium oranges (preferably Navel or Cara Cara)
- 2 cinnamon sticks (or 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon)
- 4 tablespoons Grand Marnier
- ¼ teaspoon ground allspice

## Instructions

### Stovetop Method

1. **Prepare the Oranges:**
   - Zest the oranges to obtain 2 tablespoons of zest, avoiding the bitter white pith.
   - Cut the oranges in half and squeeze to extract about ½ cup of juice.

2. **Combine Initial Ingredients:**
   - In a medium saucepan, add the cranberries, sugar, water, freshly squeezed orange juice, and the cinnamon sticks.
   - Stir the mixture to combine.

3. **Simmer the Mixture:**
   - Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.
   - Cook uncovered for 15 minutes, allowing the cranberries to soften.

4. **Add Remaining Ingredients:**
   - Stir in the orange zest, Grand Marnier, and ground allspice.
   - Continue to simmer uncovered for an additional 10–15 minutes, until the sauce reaches your desired consistency.

5. **Finalize and Chill:**
   - Remove the cinnamon sticks from the sauce.
   - Transfer the cranberry sauce to a heat-safe glass container.
   - Allow it to cool in the refrigerator before serving.

### Slow Cooker Method

1. **Combine Ingredients:**
   - Add the cranberries, sugar, water, freshly squeezed orange juice, and the cinnamon sticks to a slow cooker.
   - Cover and set to low heat, cooking for 5 hours.

2. **Add Final Touches:**
   - Stir in the orange zest, Grand Marnier, and ground allspice.
   - Cover and continue to cook for another hour.

3. **Chill Before Serving:**
   - Transfer the sauce to a container and cool in the refrigerator before serving.

## Tips

- **Texture Control:** For a chunkier sauce with semi-intact cranberries, maintain a low simmer to prevent the berries from bursting.
- **Storage:** Store the cranberry sauce in a non-metallic container in the refrigerator for up to a week.
- **Freezing:** The sauce can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before use.
