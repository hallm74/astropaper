 US regulators seek to break up Google, forcing Chrome sale as part of monopoly punishment.  Will Trump let it happen?
---
I don’t fully understand the government’s reasoning on this. While Chrome has been dominant in recent years, its position is increasingly challenged by other browsers on all operating systems except Android. With the growing integration of AI into browsers, Google’s dominance is likely to face even more competition moving forward. While I acknowledge Google’s significant influence in the browser market, it seems the ideal time to address this issue was several years ago, not now.

Also, there isn't any way this takes place before Trump takes office and he's already indicated that he might not break up the company.

>A sale of Chrome “will permanently stop Google’s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet,” Justice Department lawyers argued in their filing.

>'The reason why it's valuable to Google is because Google uses it to enhance its ad business and its search business,' said Megan Gray, former general counsel at search rival DuckDuckGO who has also worked as an attorney at the Federal Trade Commission. 'If you don't have those, then Chrome would just be a data broker.'

>While Trump's administration originally filed the search case against Google during his first term, he indicated in October he might not break up the company because it could hurt the American tech industry at a time competition is heating up with China in areas including AI.
